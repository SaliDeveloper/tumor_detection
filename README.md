# Tumor Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and classify MRI images of the brain for the diagnosis of different brain tumors. We implement a convolutional neural network for image classification using the PyTorch framework.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images categorized into four classes:
- Notumor
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary

## Implementation
We utilize PyTorch for building and training the convolutional neural network. The network architecture is designed to effectively classify MRI images into their respective tumor categories.
